In this demo we make use of:
- spring RestClient: synchronous client to make call of REST endpoints
- dummy Json data from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) is used for this demo

Note: This Rest-client demo is inspired by [Dan Vegan tutorial](https://youtu.be/UDNrJAvKc0k) and some improvements was added
